Node.js SSI Parser
====================

Trying to to implement an SSI parser for node.js. Will be starting out with some basic stuff (#include, #set, #echo etc.) and then extend to flow control.

**Note:** I've stopped working on this for the time being as I've changed my workflow to use a different templating tool.
